# React Challenge

## Frontend using React and Redux task for JOBISTY

This project is part of the process for a job application in Jobsity.

The features of the project are the following:

- One month calendar (July) where you can see the remainders that you create.
- The remainder created by the user can have the attributes of description, date, time, city and weather. The last attribute weather is taken from [OpenWeaterAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) based on the city of the remainder. The dates for the remainders have to be between July.
- The user can filter the remainders for date click on each date inside the calendar or see all remainders available by clicking on `view all remainders` above the calendar.
- Also, the user can update any attribute from the listed remainders and also the weather will update based on the new city if updated.
